Adding two floating-point numbers in the FPU (Floating Point Unit) is indeed more complex than adding integers, but the overall concept can be broken down step by step. Here’s an overview of how the FPU adds two floating-point numbers, and how logic gates and circuits are involved. We'll compare it with integer addition and focus on the key differences.

### Steps in Floating-Point Addition

1. **Unpacking the Operands:**
   - The floating-point numbers are typically stored in IEEE 754 format (single precision or double precision). This includes a sign bit, an exponent, and a mantissa (or significand).
   - The first step in adding two floating-point numbers is to unpack these components:
     - **Sign (S)**: 1 bit
     - **Exponent (E)**: 8 bits (for single precision)
     - **Mantissa (M)**: 23 bits (for single precision, with an implied leading 1)

2. **Align the Exponents:**
   - If the exponents of the two numbers are different, the smaller number’s mantissa needs to be shifted right until the exponents are aligned.
   - For example, if the exponents are 5 and 3, the mantissa of the number with exponent 3 would be shifted right by 2 bits (the difference between 5 and 3).
   - This step is crucial because, unlike integers, you can’t directly add floating-point numbers unless their exponents are the same.

3. **Add/Subtract the Mantissas:**
   - Once the exponents are aligned, the mantissas can be added or subtracted (depending on the sign bits of the two numbers).
   - The mantissa addition or subtraction is similar to integer addition or subtraction, but it takes place in the fraction domain.

4. **Normalize the Result:**
   - After the mantissas are added, the result might not be normalized. That means the leading bit of the mantissa may not be a 1 (due to the addition overflow or underflow).
   - The result is normalized by shifting the mantissa left or right and adjusting the exponent accordingly. For instance, if the sum of the mantissas resulted in an extra bit (like 1.xxxxx), the mantissa would be shifted right, and the exponent would be incremented by 1.
   - Similarly, if the result is smaller than expected, the mantissa is shifted left, and the exponent is decremented.

5. **Rounding:**
   - The final result is rounded to fit within the available bits of the mantissa (typically 23 bits for single precision). The FPU uses different rounding modes, but rounding to the nearest even is common.

6. **Repack the Result:**
   - The normalized and rounded result is repacked into the IEEE 754 format, combining the new sign, exponent, and mantissa, and stored back.

### Logical Organization Inside the FPU

The FPU is divided into several stages to handle the various steps of floating-point addition:

1. **Exponent Comparator and Aligner:**
   - The exponents are compared using a **subtraction circuit**, similar to integer subtraction. 
   - A **barrel shifter** is used to align the mantissa of the smaller number by shifting it to the right. The shifter is controlled by the exponent difference calculated in the comparison stage.
   
2. **Mantissa Addition:**
   - This step uses a **mantissa adder**, which is similar to a normal binary adder (like an integer full adder).
   - Mantissas are added bit by bit using **cascaded logic gates** (AND, OR, XOR) to propagate the carry, much like an integer adder.
   
3. **Normalization Circuit:**
   - The result of the mantissa addition may need normalization. For normalization, a **leading zero detector** is used to find how much the result should be shifted.
   - After detection, another **barrel shifter** shifts the result left or right to normalize it.

4. **Rounding Unit:**
   - The rounding circuit evaluates the bits beyond the precision limit (known as the guard, round, and sticky bits) and adjusts the final mantissa value accordingly.
   
5. **Control Logic:**
   - There is control logic to ensure that the operations happen in the correct sequence. It decides when to add, when to subtract, how to shift, and how to round the result.

### High-Level Example of FPU Addition

Let’s say you are adding two numbers: `5.75` and `-2.25`.

1. **Unpack the numbers:**
   - 5.75 in binary: `0 10000001 10111000000000000000000` (sign=0, exponent=129, mantissa=1.0111)
   - -2.25 in binary: `1 10000000 01001000000000000000000` (sign=1, exponent=128, mantissa=1.01)

2. **Align the exponents:**
   - The exponents are different (129 and 128), so we shift the mantissa of the smaller number (`-2.25`) to the right by 1, so it becomes `0.101`.

3. **Add the mantissas:**
   - Now that the exponents are aligned, add the mantissas (1.0111 and 0.101).
   - The result is `1.1001`.

4. **Normalize the result:**
   - The result is already normalized, so no shifting is needed.

5. **Rounding:**
   - In this case, no rounding is required since the result fits within the mantissa precision.

6. **Repack the result:**
   - The final result is `3.5`, represented as: `0 10000000 11000000000000000000000`.

### FPU vs Integer Addition

In **integer addition**, everything is relatively simple: you just add the bits together using a full adder. There’s no need to worry about aligning exponents, normalization, or rounding. All numbers are integers, so the logic is straightforward.

In **floating-point addition**, the FPU must handle:
1. Aligning the exponents using barrel shifters.
2. Adding the mantissas using a full adder.
3. Normalizing the result (detecting leading zeros and shifting).
4. Rounding the result.
5. Handling special cases like zero, infinity, and NaNs.

### Conclusion

While the basic principle of adding bits remains the same, the floating-point addition in an FPU is far more complex due to the need for:
- Handling different components of floating-point numbers (sign, exponent, and mantissa).
- Aligning exponents.
- Normalizing and rounding.

The FPU relies on various combinational logic blocks, like adders, barrel shifters, and leading-zero detectors, to perform these steps efficiently.
