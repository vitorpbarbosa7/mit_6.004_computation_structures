### 5. **Example in Practice**

Let's say you have a program that assembles to start at address 0x00400000 in virtual memory. When the program is loaded into memory, the operating system assigns it a physical base address in the memory, say 0x10000000.

- **Example_base** might be 0x10000000.
- **Example_bounds** might be 0x00000100 if the process's code and data take up 256 bytes.

The process's virtual address 0x00000000 (where it thinks its memory starts) would map to the physical address 0x10000000. 

### 6. **Memory Management Mechanism (Base and Bounds)**

- When a process is running in **kernel mode** (PC[31] = 1), it can access all physical memory directly.
  
- When running in **user mode** (PC[31] = 0):
  1. The MMU checks if the virtual address is within the bounds (`SEG_BOUNDS`).
  2. If it is, the address is translated by adding the base address (`SEG_BASE`) to form the physical address.
  3. If the address exceeds the bounds, a segmentation fault occurs.

### 7. **Practical Example**

Imagine the Beta computer is running the process with the following setup:

- **Process A**: Base = 0x10000000, Bounds = 0x00001000
- **Process B**: Base = 0x20000000, Bounds = 0x00001000

- **Process A**: Wants to access 0x00000400 in its virtual memory, which is translated to 0x10000400.
- **Process B**: Wants to access 0x00000400 in its virtual memory, which is translated to 0x20000400.

Both processes can have the same virtual address but will be accessing different physical locations in memory.

### Conclusion

The base and bounds system is a simple memory management technique that allows each process to have its own protected region of memory. The process table holds the necessary details for managing each process's memory and registers. This system ensures that processes don't interfere with each other's memory and allows the operating system to safely manage multiple processes.
