# mit_6.004

Repo for learning the content of MIT 6.004 Computation Structures Course.

Most of the time used the course from https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:MITx+6.004.1x_3+3T2016/home. 

But a lot of the material is also available at https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-004-computation-structures-spring-2017/

Here I provide .json files and pictures for the lab solutions.

A repo which helps a lot, and deserves credit, is this one: https://github.com/aristotle0x01/MIT-6.004/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file
