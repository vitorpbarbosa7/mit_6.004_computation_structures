So we did operations of read and write using only register, and not using read and write to memory



equal to what so what you see here is


that with a really a very relatively

simple data path we've actually just

implemented almost all of the beta

instructions okay so that's one of the

huge benefits of RISC type processors


where a RISC stands for reduced


instruction set computers where the idea

is that you instead of having verye

complex instructions that might be able


to take things like memory locations as


your source a source operands you choose


to go with a simpler route and have

potentially more instructions but
simpler ones so that the hardware that

you could have to build is much much

easier to build
