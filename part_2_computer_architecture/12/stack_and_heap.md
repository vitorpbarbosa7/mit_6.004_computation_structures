In general, stack-based memory allocation tends to be faster than heap-based memory allocation due to the following reasons:

Memory Management Overhead: Stack allocation involves simple pointer manipulation, typically just adjusting the stack pointer, which is faster than the more complex memory management routines required for heap allocation, such as searching for a suitable block of memory, updating data structures, etc.

Memory Access Speed: Accessing memory on the stack is generally faster than accessing memory on the heap. This is because stack memory is allocated in a contiguous block, leading to better cache locality and faster memory access times compared to heap memory, which may be fragmented.

Allocation and Deallocation: Stack allocation and deallocation are inherently simpler and more efficient than heap allocation and deallocation. Stack memory is automatically deallocated when the function returns, whereas heap memory requires explicit deallocation with free(), leading to potential overhead and fragmentation issues.

Thread Safety: Stack allocation is inherently thread-safe because each thread typically has its own stack, whereas heap memory management requires additional synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety, adding overhead.

However, it's essential to note that the choice between stack and heap allocation depends on the specific requirements of the application. Stack memory is limited in size and suitable for small, short-lived variables, function call management, and recursion. In contrast, heap memory is more flexible, allowing dynamic allocation of memory and is suitable for larger data structures and objects with longer lifetimes.

In the provided code, since no dynamic memory allocation is required, using stack-based memory management is both efficient and appropriate. However, for scenarios requiring dynamic memory allocation, such as variable-sized arrays or objects with uncertain lifetimes, heap-based memory allocation would be necessary, despite potentially higher overhead.
