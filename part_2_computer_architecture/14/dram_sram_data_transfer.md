how many address is possible to be read and transfered to the cache L3 at once? it is like, 10 or 100 or 1000 or 100000 address of 64 bit ?

The number of addresses that can be read and transferred to the L3 cache at once depends on several factors, including the architecture of the CPU and memory subsystem, as well as the design of the memory controller. Here are some considerations:

Cache Line Size: Typically, data is transferred in units called cache lines. A cache line is usually 64 bytes (which equals 512 bits). This means that in a single transfer, the CPU can potentially fetch 64 bytes of data from main memory to the cache.

Memory Bus and Interface: The capacity of the memory bus and the interface between the memory and the cache plays a crucial role. Modern systems often have wide memory buses (e.g., 64-bit or 128-bit) that can transfer multiple cache lines simultaneously.

Parallelism and Pipelining: As discussed earlier, memory systems utilize parallelism and pipelining to maximize throughput. This means that while one cache line is being transferred, the system can prepare for the transfer of subsequent cache lines, overlapping the stages of address generation, data retrieval, and transfer.
