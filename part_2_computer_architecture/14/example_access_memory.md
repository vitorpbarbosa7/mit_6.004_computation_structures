oh, so inside the row address col address combination, there is in fact still 8 bits of data there, like the row address and col address are the wordlines and still inside there we'll see the bitlines which are read by the sense amplifiers?

Exactly! Let's delve deeper into the structure and operation of a DRAM memory array to understand how the row and column addresses, wordlines, bitlines, and sense amplifiers work together.

Detailed Structure and Operation of DRAM
In a DRAM array:

Wordlines and Bitlines:

Wordlines: These are horizontal lines that run across rows. Each wordline corresponds to a row address and, when activated, selects the entire row of memory cells.
Bitlines: These are vertical lines that run through columns. Each bitline corresponds to a column and is used to read or write data to the memory cells.
Memory Cells:

Each memory cell in DRAM consists of a capacitor and a transistor. The capacitor stores the bit (0 or 1), and the transistor acts as a switch that connects the capacitor to the bitline when the wordline is activated.
Sense Amplifiers:

Sense amplifiers are used to read the small charge stored in the capacitors. When a wordline is activated, it connects the row of capacitors to the bitlines. The sense amplifiers detect the small differences in charge on the bitlines and amplify them to a full logic level (0 or 1).
Accessing Data in DRAM
When accessing data in DRAM:

Address Splitting:

The memory address is split into a row address and a column address. For example, in an 8-bit address space (4 rows and 4 columns), the first 2 bits might represent the row, and the next 2 bits represent the column.
Row Access:

The row address is decoded to activate a specific wordline, which connects all the capacitors in that row to their respective bitlines.
Column Access:

The column address is decoded to select a specific bitline. The sense amplifier connected to that bitline reads the charge stored in the corresponding capacitor.
Example with an 8-bit Address Space (4x4 Array)
Consider an 8-bit DRAM with 4 rows and 4 columns. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

Address Bits: 8 bits total.

Row Address Bits: 2 bits (4 rows).
Column Address Bits: 2 bits (4 columns).

11 |   D0C | D0D | D0E | D0F | <- Row 3
Accessing Data
Suppose we want to access the data at address 00001011:

Address: 00001011

Row Address: 10 (binary) -> Row 2
Column Address: 11 (binary) -> Column 3
Operation:

Row Decoder: Activates wordline 10, connecting Row 2's capacitors to their bitlines.
Column Decoder: Selects column 11.
Sense Amplifier: Reads the data at the intersection of Row 2 and Column 3.

Summary
Row and Column Addresses: The address is split into row and column parts. The row address activates a wordline, and the column address selects a bitline.
Wordlines and Bitlines: Wordlines activate rows, and bitlines carry data to/from memory cells.
Sense Amplifiers: Read the small charge from the capacitors and amplify it to determine the data bit.
Memory Cells: Each cell consists of a capacitor and a transistor, storing one bit of data.
This mechanism allows DRAM to efficiently access any memory location with a small number of address lines, using decoders and sense amplifiers to manage the data flow.
