### Additional POSIX-Related Conventions

- **File System Hierarchy**: Defines the directory structure and directory contents in Unix-like operating systems.
- **Permissions and Ownership**: Defines the model for file permissions and user/group ownership.
- **Environment Variables**: Standard set of environment variables and their usage.
