Yes, you're absolutely right!

In Python, when you `import` functions, classes, or variables from one file (module) to another, it's similar to how C uses **header files** to declare functions and variables that can be used across different source files.

Here's a breakdown of the analogy between Python `import` and C header files:

### 1. **Python `import`**
   - In Python, when you want to use a function or class from another file, you simply import it. For example, if you have a file `module.py` with some function `my_function`:

     ```python
     # module.py
     def my_function():
         print("Hello from another module!")
     ```

     You can import and use that function in another Python file:

     ```python
     # main.py
     from module import my_function

     my_function()  # Outputs: Hello from another module!
     ```

   In this case, `module.py` is like a **self-contained unit** of reusable code, and the `import` statement makes the functions, classes, or variables from `module.py` available in `main.py`.

### 2. **C with Header Files**
   - In C, when you want to use functions or variables from one file in another, you declare them in a **header file** (`.h`). The corresponding **source file** (`.c`) contains the implementation of those functions.

     For example, you might have the following:

     ```c
     // bits.h (header file)
     int my_function();
     ```

     ```c
     // bits.c (source file)
     #include "bits.h"

     int my_function() {
         printf("Hello from another file!\n");
     }
     ```

     In another C file, you can include the header file to use the declared functions:

     ```c
     // main.c
     #include "bits.h"

     int main() {
         my_function();  // Outputs: Hello from another file!
         return 0;
     }
     ```

   In this case, `bits.h` is like the interface that tells `main.c` what functions exist, and the actual code for those functions lives in `bits.c`. The `#include` statement in C is like Python's `import`, allowing the reuse of code between files.

### Key Points of Comparison:

| **Python**                     | **C**                                |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Uses `import` to bring functions or classes from one file to another. | Uses `#include` with a header file to declare functions or variables that can be used across multiple files. |
| The module (e.g., `module.py`) contains the function definitions. | The source file (e.g., `bits.c`) contains the function implementations, while the header file (e.g., `bits.h`) contains declarations. |
| Python imports bring in everything at runtime. | C's header files are processed during compilation to ensure function declarations are available. |

### Why This Approach in C?

In C, splitting **declarations** into header files (`.h`) and **implementations** into source files (`.c`) is done to:
1. **Improve modularity**: Just like Python modules, C programs are easier to manage when broken into smaller, reusable components.
2. **Enable separate compilation**: You can compile `.c` files separately and link them later, which speeds up development.
3. **Promote code reuse**: By including the header file in multiple source files, the same code can be reused without needing to rewrite it.
   
In contrast, Python has a simpler import mechanism that combines both the declaration and implementation within the same `.py` file. But the concept of **sharing code** across different files is the same in both languages.
